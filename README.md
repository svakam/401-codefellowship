## Overview
- This project demonstrates my ability to create a fully functional CRUD-based RESTful API that implements Spring Security as a form of Authentication.

## Installation and Run
- Clone this repo into your local machine. 
- Open Gradle at this repository and click the play button. You should see the server initializing and starting in your terminal. 
- Open a browser session and type "localhost:8080" in the URL field. The app should now be running. 

## Acknowledgements
